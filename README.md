I did this project to understand Django more deeply

# To Try this out you have to follow the steps: #

* Clone the repository into a directory.
* You must have Python 3.8.5 or higher, but beware the packages might not work as intended if the version changes.
* To create the virtual Environment open you command-line
  * Windows:
    python -m venv 'env_name'
  * Mac:
    python3 source 'env_name'
* Once the venv is created you must activate it and install the required packages
* To activate it you must execute the activate script in 'env_name'/Scripts/activate
  
  * Windows:
    So simple execute the command 'env_name'\Scripts\activate
* The requirements.txt is included in the repository so jus execute the command pip install -r requirements.txt
